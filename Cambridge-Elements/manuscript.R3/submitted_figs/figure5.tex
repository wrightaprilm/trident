\caption{\textbf{The complete versus reconstructed trees under birth-death process models.}
The assumptions of four different models are captured in each row.
The first column shows an example outcome of the joint diversification and sampling processes (i.e., the complete tree), where diamonds represent  extant or fossil samples.
The second column shows the tree that contains sampled lineages only (i.e., the reconstructed tree). 
The third column shows the parameters and the name commonly applied to model used to described the probability of observing the reconstructed tree shown in column two, given we assume the generating processes shown in column one.
In all cases we assume constant speciation, extinction and fossil recovery, and uniform extant species sampling.
Trees and fossils were simulated and plotted using the R packages \texttt{TreeSim} \citep{Stadler2011} and \texttt{FossilSim} \citep{BaridoSottani2019b}. \rev{Code to reproduce this figure is provided in the supplement.}}
