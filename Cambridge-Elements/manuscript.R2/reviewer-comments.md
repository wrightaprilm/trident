One thing I thought might help “sell” the paper to an phylogenetically unfamiliar audience of paleontologists would be to highlight more empirical case studies mostly or entirely comprised of fossil data (to help point readers to examples on groups having fossil records like the one they know best). That said, I wouldn’t necessarily advocate any additional section(s) be added to compensate--just a thought.

Although the joint estimation of relationships and node ages is emphasized in the manuscript (and in the literature), I think it’s worth briefly mentioning the possibility of dating taxonomy-based phylogenies of fossil taxa. Although this should be done with caution, this approach could benefit paleontological studies of trait evolution, which typically do not incorporate information on relationships at all. This issue is discussed in Soul and Friedman (2015) and I think it might be helpful to some paleo-focused readers if it were mentioned (only a sentence or two would be needed). 

**Done**

Bit to help sell the paper.

3rd paragraph: Would it be helpful to include a figure showing how the shape of a distribution (e.g., gamma, beta) changes with different combinations of parameter values? It might help readers understand what’s meant by a “flexible” prior. I guess this is sort of addressed in figure 4 though.
